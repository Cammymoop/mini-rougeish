needs pygame installed
run using gl4es python3

something is really killing the framerate while running the reveal algorithm (the first frame the algorithm runs is very slow so it tries to generate a lot the next frame which is even slower)

framerate in general degrades over time, I think this is from increasing number of entities being rendered but could be other stuff effecting it too
